# immutability
Adds immutability to objects


pip install code
-----------------
pip install https://github.com/Zxython/immutability/archive/refs/heads/main.zip


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
This immutability may not work directly with custom classes, especially if attributes are not changed through function calls. To make a custom class immutable simply place the object inside of an immutable list, dictionary, tuple, or set. (I reccomend placing it in a immutable list as that is what I mainly test).
